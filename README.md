# AFL-Attendance-Prediction
The aim of this project was to use machine learning algorithms to predict the attendances of AFL matches. The idea was inspired by the desire to develop my data science skills and my interest in the AFL. There were 4 main stages to the project:
* Data collection (from online sources)
* Data preparation (cleaning and combining the 7 raw data files)
* Feature engineering (creating new informative features from the data)
* Building machine learning models (to make the actual predictions)

NOTE: this project is still in progress
